The complete ROV model is in the file named "shapemorphv3.xml".

The folder "rov simulation" holds the files necessary to load in the mesh models of each piece of the rov and the arms. If you change the path of any model, make sure to change its path that is specified in "shapemorphv3.xml"

If you solely want to test the arms, then you can go into the "hand simulation" directory, and then the folder named "rx5 obj files". That is where you will find "rx5v3.xml" which will model the hand.
